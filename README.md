# Workshop: Metagenomics and pathogen discovery

- Jackie Mahar (University of Sydney)
- Mang Shi (University of Sydney and Sun Yat-sen University)

This workshop will provide training on how to find potential pathogens in meta-transcriptomic data. This will include guidelines for (i) de novo assembly of meta-transcriptomic data, (ii) taxonomic assignment and annotation of assembled transcripts/genomes and (iii) comprehensive characterisation of potential pathogens, including identification of false positives. Participants will be guided through a bioinformatics pipeline using a reduced dataset on a high-performance computer with the required software and databases already installed. The software required for this workshop are [PuTTY](https://www.putty.org/) (if working from a Windows machine) and an FTP client such as [FileZilla](https://filezilla-project.org/). Participants are assumed to have a basic understanding of command line.
